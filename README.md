# ByteTorch

ByteTorch is a small deep learning library written in Python, inspired by PyTorch. It's a personal project for learning and experimenting with neural networks from the inside. The code is simple and open—feel free to read, use, or break things as you like.

## What you'll find here
- Custom autograd engine - a minimal implementation of automatic differentiation and backpropagation
- Clear and well-organized code - designed to be easy to read and modify
- Essential neural network layers - including Linear, activation functions, Dropout, and BatchNorm
- Optimizers - SGD, Adam, and a straightforward way to add your own
- Example Jupyter notebooks - practical demonstrations for regression and classification

## Why ByteTorch?
ByteTorch is designed for those who want to better understand the inner workings of deep learning frameworks. It can serve as a learning resource, a base for experimenting with custom layers or optimizers, or a lightweight tool for small projects and educational purposes.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ffenix7/ByteTorch.git
    cd ByteTorch
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Try out the example notebooks:
    - `notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb`
    - `notebooks/classification_example.ipynb`

You can open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells to see ByteTorch in action.
